"""
So in the last two sections we covered strings and list but in this one we will be getting a bit more abstract with collections. now a collection isnt really a data type is a "collection"
of different or the same data type. in this section we will be going over three data types with list, libararies, and tuples. i think tuples is the one i know the least about at the current
momnet. now a list fucntions a ton like an array from JavaScript or C#. a list or collection of various variables or classes or what ever you want really. now a dictionary or libarary works
with keys. where something has a key which has a corrilating value to it. that could be a funciton or an operator and just a normal variable. now a tuple, from what he has said so far, is 
strucuted much like the list. he didn't go into detail on how its different but says it more like the list rather then the dictonary.
