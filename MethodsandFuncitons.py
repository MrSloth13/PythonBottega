a methon or function can store instructions and proccesses you can call back at 
a latter time. there is the inuput, the function itself, and the return of what 
you want back. so its nice to be able have a funciton that you can call when you
need it and if there is a change to be made you can just change the original 
function and it should update everywhere else as well.
