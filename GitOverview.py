What is git?

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system.

-Open source:
Free to use and developed by a community of developers.

-Distributed:
Centralized code repository.
:: This is used for either a good backup or one of the best ways to develope code within a team. since you both can start with the same source file but you can
branch off it and it will not effect the original file. 

-Version Control System:
Gives teh ability to create milestones for a project.
:: so in a nut shell you can branch off a "version" of the project into a new branch and make it your new main branch in the feature set and stability make sense
to do so. Now this means that you can always go back. all versions are saved in git. so if you make a new branch and then when you put in back in and everything 
breaks, you can go back to the stable version and try again.

So what is the difference?

Well its kinda in the name. GitHub is a hub for the git repository. git is a centralized version control system but unless its on a server(github) you are really 
the only one that can work on it. where if we go back a section, one of the main benifits of git is that multiple people can work on it. so it make sense to have 
a place where anyone from anywhere can get access to the centralized version system. github is also a visual layer to git. there is a version that is visible to 
the terminal but that isn't as nice to look at.

And thats it. i knew it wouldn't be much but i can see git being a really hard thing to understand and get working if you are very new to programming so module one
was a great choice to put it.
