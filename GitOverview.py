What is git?

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system.

-Open source:
Free to use and developed by a community of developers.

-Distributed:
Centralized code repository.
:: This is used for either a good backup or one of the best ways to develope code within a team. since you both can start with the same source file but you can
branch off it and it will not effect the original file. 

-Version Control System:
Gives teh ability to create milestones for a project.
:: so in a nut shell you can branch off a "version" of the project into a new branch and make it your new main branch in the feature set and stability make sense
to do so. Now this means that you can always go back. all versions are saved in git. so if you make a new branch and then when you put in back in and everything 
breaks, you can go back to the stable version and try again.
