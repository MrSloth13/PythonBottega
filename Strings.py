#String Basics --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

sentence = 'The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog'
# sentence = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
# Note that python doesn't care like other languages on which on you use ("" or '') it will treat is as the same. 

print(sentence)

sentence_two = "That is my dog's bowl" # you would want to use one over the other if the content you have uses one of them, use the oppisite on the outside. 
sentence_three = 'That is my dog\'s bowl' # is that is now possible putting a forward slash (honestly i still don't know which is which. it could be a back slash but its the one that is above the enter key on the right of the keyboard) and python will run it correctly
sentence_four = 'Tiffany said, "Thats my dog\'s bowl' #you could even use it mulitiple times through out the sentence and it will still work with the forward slash. 

print(sentence_two)
print(sentence_three)
print(sentence_four)
