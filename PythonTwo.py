# when making a variable you just make the name what you want (make sure spaces use a _) then an = then the data you want to store. 
# the type cast of python is very similar to javaScript where it figures out what type of data is attached and you do not need to call int or string 
# when calling the variable. 
name = 'Kristine'
post_count = 43
# that is the normal naming convention for a class name. this is why the variable names look the way they do. its called a snake case. the other way is called camel case. 
# PostCount = 43
PostCount = 43
# so in python use snake case for varible names and use camel case for class names.

print(name, post_count)
print(name)
print(post_count)
print(PostCount)
