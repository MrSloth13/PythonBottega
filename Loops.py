"""
So there are two types of list in python. there is a 'for in' loop and a 'while' loop. a for in loop will run through as many items as you have. simple and will be use about 90% of the time. the 
while loop is similar to C# in where if you dont give it an exit point or a point to end it will just go on and crash the system with an infinite loop. but just like it C# the while loop can still 
be useful. especially if you dont want to go through an enitre list to save on resources.
